Warning from spectre.
    WARNING: The analog engine (Spectre, UltraSim or APS) has completed and therefore you can no longer access analog values. Check to see if the values you need are available through simVision, if they are part of a saved waveform, or consider adding tcl commands that access the analog values at the desired time before the analog engine finishes, and then restart the simulation.
